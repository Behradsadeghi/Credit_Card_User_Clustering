# Segmentation-Analysis-of-Active-Credit-Card-Users


This project involves clustering and segmenting around 9,000 active credit card users based on their behavior over a six-month period, using 18 behavioral variables. Customer data is preprocessed and reduced to two dimensions via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). K-Means clustering is then applied to group customers into four distinct clusters, enabling analysis of their behaviors and identification of cluster-specific characteristics.
